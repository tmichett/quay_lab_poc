== Quay Setup Playbooks for Home Lab

This guide is meant to provide instructions on how to use the playbooks in this project. The playbooks will deploy a local instance of Quay Container registry as containers running on the specified Ansible managed hosts.

The process automates the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.5/html/deploy_red_hat_quay_for_proof-of-concept_non-production_purposes (Quay Proof of Concept) process from Red Hat.

=== Preparing the System and Deploying Quay

==== Preparing a System for Quay

These instructions have been tested on a RHEL8 system that has already been subscripted to a content repository and has the ability to download and install packages. The playbooks will attempt to install *podman* and any other dependencies needed for deployment of Quay and its supporting containers.

.Storage Space and Considerations
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using this for a *production* or operational workload, you will want to give considerations to the system running and hosting the containers for back-end storage.

For these instructions, we are mounting the */quay* directory from the host filesystem and other directories under there to be used as persistent storage for the running containers. This is also where the container images will be stored. It is recommended to have this space as a separate mount point (LVM) so it can be easily expanded as your registry grows.
====

For the test and demonstration environment, I've used a local virtual machine named *quay.local* and gave the system the following resources:

* 64GB Virtual Disk
* 6 vCPUs
* 16GB RAM

Another important requirement before beginning the lab and deployment is to ensure that SSH keys for the root user have been copied to your system that will be hosting the Quay containers and that you've modified the */etc/hosts* file on you Ansible control node so that it can properly deployed the containers based on the playbooks.

. Copy SSH key from Ansible control node to the Quay host

. Modify the */etc/hosts* file so that you can reach the Quay server by FQDN.

==== Quay Deployment Preparation

Run a set of Ansible playbooks to setup the environment with the needed containers and container images to provide support to Quay. This will also allow the Quay container image to be downloaded and enter a configuration mode to create the *quay-config.tar.gz* file.

.Demonstration and Instructions *skip* the Quay Configuration File
[TIP]
====
For time purposes, the configuration of the Quay environment is being skipped. It is possible to use these same playbooks, but for the deployment if you choose to use the configuration container, you would modify the *ansible-playbook Quay_Config_Deploy_Files.yml* command to be *ansible-playbook Quay_Config_Deploy_Tar.yml*. This will also require that you have placed the *quay-config.tar.gz* file in the *_files_* directory relative to the Ansible playbook.
====

. Run the Quay_Prepare.yml playbook to prepare the system for deploying Quay.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The playbook will pause to allow you to update or create a new Quay configuration TGZ file. You will be accessing a specialized Quay configuration container at *http://FQDN:8080* to complete a web form. You will be logging in with the passwords that were setup for the playbook. In this instance, it is:

* *Username*: quayconfig

Sometimes it takes a while for Clair to come up. If Clair isn't fully up and operational before you attempt deploying the *Quay* container or the *Quay-Mirror* container, they will both fail because of failure to communicate with the security scanner container.

=== Setting Up Quay

After all Quay containers have been configured and installed, it is necessary to setup the Admin (Superuser) for Quay as well as test out the system for both image scanning and the ability to mirror container images from upstream repositories.

==== Configuring the Quay Super User

After the Quay registry has been deployed, it is important to finish configuring the super users (admins) that were defined as part of the setup and configuration file (*config.yaml*) that was created during the Quay preparation section.

It is necessary to look at the *config.yaml* file and configure these users with a password and create the accounts officially before moving forward with utilizing the Quay container registry and the lab environment.

.Configure Quay Super Users
[IMPORTANT]
====
It is possible to either look in the configuration file of the *quay-config.tar.gz* or the actual *config.yaml* file for the *_SUPER_USERS_* section. This is where the usernames are defined that will function as Quay super users.

.Quay Super Users
[source,yaml]
----
SUPER_USERS:
    - quayadmin
    - travis
----
====

. Open the Quay web console by navigating to it in your favorite browser using *http://Quay-FQDN:8080*
+

. Click *Create Account* to create the administrator/superuser accounts for Quay as defined in the *config.yaml* file.
** Repeat this step for all super users in the *config.yaml* file.

+
image::README-4c04a.png[]

. Verify the account was setup properly and you have *Super User* rights by clicking your Username and looking for *Super User Admin Panel*.
+

==== Testing Clair Image Scanner

In order to test the scanning capabilities and ensure that things function properly, update a basic image into the Quay Repository

. Login to Quay Repository
+
.*podman* Authentication

==== Testing Quay Image Mirroring

The next step is to ensure that the QUAY Image mirroring container is working and that you can successfully mirror container images from upstream repositories.

. Create a new repository in Quay by clicking *Create New Repository*
+
image::README-a249a.png[]

. Give repository a name and setup the repository visibility
+
image::README-e0e97.png[]

. In the newly created repository, click the *Settings* option from the left-side navigation menu. Set the *Repository State* to *_Mirror_*.
+
image::README-cec53.png[]

. In the newly created repository, click the *Mirroring* option from the left-side navigation menu.
+
image::README-0e703.png[]

. In the *Mirroring* tab, complete the required information for the repository and create a *Robot User*. Click *Enable Mirror*
